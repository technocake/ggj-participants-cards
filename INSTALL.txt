Dependencies:

pip install requests
pip install requests-cache
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install flask


# Configuration

It works out of the box! NO configuration is needed to use it.
However it is possible to specify some neat things through 
the config.py file.


File: config.py

If not provided, a minimum config file will be automatically created.


make a file named config.py,
WEBROOT
	if deploying on apache/x-server you probably need to change
	the working dir of the python instance to /path/to/these/files

	WEBROOT = "/path/to/this/folder"

	You can deploy your httpserver to flask.wsgi in this folder. 
	for apache, mod_wsgi is needed.


SECRET_KEY
	flask sesions needs this key in order to encrypt session state. 
	make it, and keep it secret!

	SECRET_KEY = "definitively not this"
	(this will now be created automatically if no config.py exists when running first time.)


ggj_url
	link to your sites jammers.csv download file (saves time)

	Example:
		ggj_url = 'http://globalgamejam.org/group/<node-id>/jammers.csv'


sources
	By default there is only one source, jammers.csv for info on the jammers.
	However, you can specify any number of csv files that will be imported,
	in the order they are listed. 


	Example:
		sources = [
			{
				'file': 'jammers.csv'	
			},
			
			{
				'url': 'https://goo.gl/forms/xmeoimfeoifm/format=csv', 'fields': 'name-of-file.txt'
			}
		]

extra
	Include extra fields from other sources in rendering. 
	Currently:	'Experience', 'Size' and 'Education'
	Example:
		extra=True


#################################################
#	Using Google Forms
#################################################

	if using google forms as secondary source of input for the jammers, 
	one needs to map the fields in the google forms to fields of jammers.csv 
	(from GGJ.org). This is done with a textfile,  forms_fields.txt is an example of this. (make another for your needs)

	Then in sources (see above), specify the name of the file like this:
	Example:
		sources = [
			{
				'file': 'jammers.csv'	
			},
			
			{
				'url': 'https://goo.gl/forms/xmeoimfeoifm/format=csv', 'fields': 'name-of-file.txt'
			}
		]

	it should list the fieldnames per line in the following syntax

	Username:What is your username at GGJ.org?
	Email:What is your email?
	...
	Skills:Tick of your skills in these checboxes
