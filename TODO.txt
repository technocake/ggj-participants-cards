Wolfram, 
	- There was only one question why some of the avatar icons were small and some were large on the cards.


	- Another tiny problem popped up during printing the cards. Some jammers checked almost all of the skill options. As a result the badge was to large to fit on the page.

	- Would be cool if we could simply manually remove some of the skills

	- What I did was printing it first into a pdf file. One badge per page. Then I used Acrobat Reader for actually printing the badges and used the print multiple pages per sheet feature. I printed 4 badges per sheet A4 paper. So the resulting badge was in the format A6.

	Used own card system. 
	 I'm just saying our cards came without name, so writing it themselves was a nice thing for some people. 


Bergen:
	- We lost control on who had actually showed up and not, and as a result,
	many groups where made with ghost members (who had signed up in advance, but didn't show up). It was bad for the groups.
